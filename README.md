# Luke Designs
Project - Website portfolio design for a digital illustrator

<h1 align="center">Lukes's Portfolio Project</h1>

[View the live project here.](TBC)

This is my milestone project for the L5 Web Development Diploma with Code Institute. This project will have an heavy focus on User Centric Front End Development.

<h1 align="center">Table of Content</h1>

# **Initial discussion**

Luke is a close friend of mine with a talent in digital illustration who specialises in sports shoes (specially basketball) illustrations for marketing and advertising purposes. He has always been able to get projects through recommendations from former acquaintances, but these recommendations have now slowed down somewhat. He has relied on sending each client he has worked with an email with his past project attached but he understands that to reach new potential clients, he would need an online portfolio/presence to showcase his work.

I will be building this website for him in this project.


# **Target Audience:**

With Luke being an illustration mostly embedded within sports shoe design company’s marketing team; the demographic falls under two categories

#### **Corporate clients - specifically their marketing teams**

- Sport shoes companies -- To use his work for a marketing/advertisement campaign.
- Design & Fashion house/companies -- To use his work to bring their ideas and sketches to live.

#### **Individual clients**

- Shoe/Trainers Collectors -- Since they cannot wear the rare collectable shoes due to their value, some collectors might find his work appealing as a one of a kind art piece especially if they end up selling the shoes. These art work could work as both a sentimental value and maybe even advertising material before they sell these shoes.

# **User Stories:**

#### **Client Goals**

My client goals are very clear. His requirement are as below:
- Have an stronger online presence
- Showcase his art-work and talent
- Appear more professional to potential clients
- Create opportunities for yet unknown clients to get in touch with him (forms)

#### **First Time Visitor Goals**

The aim for first time visitors are:
- Visibility to his past work
- Learn more about my client as an artist/illustrator
- Learn more about his past clients/projects
- Be able to reach out and contact him (Social media and forms)

#### **Returning Visitors**
- See an updated gallery of new works/projects
- To show his work to others in their circle and potential clients

 # **Strategic Tradeoffs**
-   ASSIGNED FIGURES TBC


# **Design**

## **Colour Scheme**
Since a personal portfolio reflects the artist work; there are a varied amount of colour schemes that could be applied. Based on this, I spoke to my client and we settled on a team of colors to use.

I was able to establish his by using the 60/30/10 Colour Rule. I learnt this during my research for this project. Used this youtube tutorial to really understand this rule - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWwNIMHFdW4

As a result, we came to the decision to use the below colour scheme. We felt it would give his work the kind of profession/exclusive look he is looking for:

<img src="assets/readme/colour_pallet.png" alt="colour pallet with there colours. Black, Orange and Green" width="500" height="auto" style= "max-width: 100%">

60% - Black – Primary Colour

30% - Orange – Secondary Colour

10% - Green – Call to Action - CTA

---

## **Typography**

To keep things simple. We decided to go for Roboto and San Serif as a back up text. I will be embedding this text from the Google Font server using Regular 400 and Bold 700 font style. The Roboto text is well known for it professionalism and simplicity whereas the San-serif text is a more safer option due to the fact that every computer had this text pre install so the website should be able to display correctly if the Roboto text is unavailable.

<img src="assets/readme/Roboto.png" alt="image of the choosen typography - Roboto" width="700" height="auto" style= "max-width: 100%">

## **Images**

Part of the prep for this project; I quickly realised acquiring images that fit my vision for this project was a time consuming one and the results were not satisfactory. To fix this issue, I decided to create my own set of images. This idea would be more efficient, hit the level for the kind of images I wanted to use for this project and remove any copy write issues now or in the near future.

**All the images used on this project would be AI (Artificial Intelligent) Generated** by creating prompts in order to create an image (example below) using a platform called [Mid Journey](https://midjourney.com/). You can learn more about Mid Journey [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney)

**Midjourney prompts used are**

"Artist Image" Prompt:
- an african american man smiling with black hair, in the style of louis, light brown and emerald, celebrity and pop culture references, marble, distinct facial features, rim light, undulating lines, hyper-realistic, 8k --ar 1:1 --v 5 --s 250


"My Work" Prompts:
- an abstract print of a colorful basketball shoe, in the style of zbrush, dark & explosive, uhd image, flowing forms, homosexual themes, raw materials, photobashing --ar 7:4

     2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
     3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
     2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
     3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
     1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
     2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
     3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

     1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
     2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

  2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

     1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
     2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.

     5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

  3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
     1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
     2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
     3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.
