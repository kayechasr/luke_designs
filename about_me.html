                    Hello! <br /><br />
                    Im Luke and welcome! <br /><br />
                    As an illustrator embedded within the marketing team of a
                    sports/active shoe companies, my role is to bring a unique blend
                    of creativity and artistic expertise to the table. I've always had
                    a passion for art since I was young, which eventually led me to
                    study it at school and university. However, over time, my interest
                    in art evolved into a fascination with digital illustrations,
                    specifically in the context of basketball shoes, given my love for
                    the sports. <br />
                    <br />
                    My style is known for its vibrant colours, intricate details, and
                    dynamic compositions, all of which help to make the advertising
                    campaigns I work on stand out from the crowd. Whether it's
                    creating illustrations for print ads, social media campaigns, or
                    other advertising materials, I focus on producing work that is
                    colourful and visually stunning. <br /><br />
                    I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with
                    digital illustration. By combining my technical skills with my
                    passion for art and design, I am able to create work that not only
                    looks great but also helps to drive sales and grow brand presence. <br><br>
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my work,
                    and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you!
